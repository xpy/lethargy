            This Site is an experimental Portfolio created to demonstrate the capabilities of
            <abbr data-title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. The challenge, was to create an
            interactive and fully functional Portfolio without a single line of <abbr data-title="JavaScript">JS</abbr>.
            I want to point out that this was made just for fun and this is <strong>not</strong> the right way to
            create websites.
        </p>

        <p>
            Even though all the content was created by <abbr data-title="See About Page For Details...">me</abbr>,
            this is not a real Portfolio, the content is just for demonstrating purposes and that's the reason there
            is no actual meaning or specific consistency to it. It could be
            <abbr data-title="Common placeholder (filler) text">Lorem Ipsum</abbr>, it is nonsense poetic stuff instead.
        </p>

        <p>I hope you enjoy your stay.</p>
