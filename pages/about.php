            Hmm... My Name is Pavlos Chrisochoidis, I suck at this but I'll try...<br>
            Ahem...

        <p>
            I am Web Developer from Greece and although I earn my bread through
            Web Development, I don't consider myself a Professional, actually I don't consider myself a Professional in
            any field, instead, I am an amateur in many, I code, I paint,I read, I write and I cook
            (not always in that order and never all together...).
        </p>

        <p>
            I got in Web Development some years ago (like... 4 I think?), and since my studies in College had nothing to
            do with the web, I had to learn it all by myself, the first thing I learned is that www stands for
            Work-Work-Work ( second was "Can't Style Shit" ) * Third was "Never Stop Telling Stupid Jokes".

        <h2 class="lined">The Project</h2>

        <p> Using CSS to mimic things that were only possible with Javascript, such as tabs, clickable drop-down menus etc,
            was always a challenge. In this Project, I tried gather all this 'tricks' I've learned or manifested,
            to create this simple Portfolio. Not actually a portfolio but anyway...
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite the fact that I used no Javascript at all, there is a lot of PHP behind this, mostly for repetitive
            tasks, weird calculations and brain-damaging 2d and 3d transforms. I don't know if it could be
            possible without PHP. I also used SASS ( for the first time in my life ) which also helped a lot, but I ended up with those
            HUGE selectors. I didn't use any media queries and I don't plan to because the design sucks and I don't think it
            could fit in a very small screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Design is mine, I know I'm not so good at it but I tried my best to keep it as simple and minimal as I could.
            The Drawings are also mine, they are details from bigger drawings actually.
            I also wrote the little surreal descriptions which, as I said before, they are there just to fill the space.
